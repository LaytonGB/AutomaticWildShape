Roll20 API for Automatically Wild Shaping using the Roll20 D&amp;D 5th Edition OGL Sheet.

-----

In order to prepare a beast for wild-shaping, complete this checklist:
1) Make sure the beast has a player-uploaded default token.
2) Make sure you're using a filled out Roll20 D&D 5e Character Sheet.
3) ??? - If its not working with a default SRD monster sheet & blank player-uploaded default token then something has gone wrong. Hit me up at the link below.

To override the class requirement of "Druid" and disable the CR limit set by character level:
1) Create an attribute on the NPC or PC sheet.
2) Name the attribute "aws_override".
3) Set the attribute value to "1".
If a PC is using the "aws_override" attribute the GM will be notified.
